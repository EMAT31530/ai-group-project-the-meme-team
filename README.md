# Rocket Lander Repository

This is the repository for the Rocket Lander project, as part of EMAT31530 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

The goal is to use Unity to train an AI agent to land a rocket, inspired by the work by SpaceX. This will be facilitated through the use of the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimisation) learning algorithm, implemented through the Unity ML-Agents Package. A custom environment will be used for training and testing, allowing for a detailed investigation into the capabilities of the agent as a result of different environmental settings.
