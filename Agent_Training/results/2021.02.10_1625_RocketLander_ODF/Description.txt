Sensors: 13 (3*position, 4*rotation, 3*velocity, 3*angular velocity)
Actuators: 3 (joystick, throttle - mapping extended to [0,1.1] followed by clamping)
DOF: Full DOF
Drag: 0.1
Angular Drag: 0.1
RW_Alignment: 0.5
RW_Vertical: 0.5

Reward Shaping:
Penalty for leaving environment = -10f
Penalty for missing target = -5f
Reward for hitting target = 5f
Reward/Penalty based on if agent is pointing towards target (negative if pointing away)
Reward/Penalty based on if agent is pointing vertically

Experimental Results / Observations:
TRAINED ON SINGLE AGENT
Agent stabilises and hovers vertically for ~1sec then becomes unstable
