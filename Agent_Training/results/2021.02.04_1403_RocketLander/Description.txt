Sensors: 13 (3*position, 4*rotation, 3*velocity, 3*angular velocity)
Actuators: 3 (joystick, throttle - mapping extended to [0,1.1] followed by clamping)
DOF: Full DOF
Drag: 0.1
Angular Drag: 0.1

Reward Shaping:
Penalty for leaving environment = -10f
Penalty for missing target = -5f
Reward for hitting target = 5f

Experimental Results / Observations:
Agent appears to want to backflip, but was also capable of exploring the space during initial training
When close to the target, it appears to direct towards this, but not when far away
This indicates it may have struggled with corresponding a far distance with enough reason for aiming for the target
