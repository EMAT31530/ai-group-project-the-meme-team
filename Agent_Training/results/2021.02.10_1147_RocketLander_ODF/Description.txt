Sensors: 13 (3*position, 4*rotation, 3*velocity, 3*angular velocity)
Actuators: 3 (joystick, throttle - mapping extended to [0,1.1] followed by clamping)
DOF: Full DOF
Drag: 0.1
Angular Drag: 0.1

Reward Shaping:
Penalty for leaving environment = -10f
Penalty for missing target = -5f
Reward for hitting target = 5f
Reward/Penalty based on if agent is pointing towards target (negative if pointing away)

Experimental Results / Observations:
Agent tends to track target and ends up dive-bombing towards it. This is likely because it gets rewarded for doing so.
Also getting penalised for pointing away, causing it to dive towards the target.
